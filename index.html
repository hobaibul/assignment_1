                    father, a successful goldsmith, encouraged him to pursue higher education. After graduating from Dhaka University in
                    Bangladesh, Professor Yunus received a Fulbright Scholarship to study Economics at Vanderbilt University in the
                    United States, where he received a Ph.D. in 1971. While in the U.S., he also taught Economics at Middle Tennessee
                    University. He returned to Bangladesh upon its independence in 1972 to serve as the Head of the Economics
                    Department at the University of Chittagong.</p>
